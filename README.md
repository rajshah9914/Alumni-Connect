# Alumni-Connect
This web app was introduced as a need to curtail the gap between distanced Alumni’s of the institute so that their proximity to the institute and some precious years spent in by them can be maintained. An alumni is one of the pillars of the building without which none would had survived. This application allows alumnis of various departments and years to connect contact with each other, spend some quality time for a meet, discuss about the present lifestyles, or may be past or upcoming future.   They are the Alumnis who will raise the profile of the University up to the sky. Their contributions to the Institute, be it mentoring , fund raising, some development , help to the students studying presently, easing Job opportunities to the needy , and many more boost up the institute’s name and fame outside, in the industry. Thus, ‘Alumni Connect’ is one of such initiative where all are brought together on a common platform.
